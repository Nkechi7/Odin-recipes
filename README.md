# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project, where I built a basic recipe website using only HTML.

- How to structure a basic HTML page with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- How to use headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
- How to insert images into a webpage.
- How to use relative links to connect multiple HTML pages.
- Basic Git version control workflow.
